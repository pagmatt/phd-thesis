% Mobile networks play a key role in our society and are poised to become ever more important in the coming years. 
% The recent COVID-19 pandemic has not only reiterated this importance, but it also highlighted how the lack of high-speed Internet connectivity represents, in our day and time, a severe hindrance to our social, professional end educational life.
% In fact, while providing noteworthy peak performance, the current generation of cellular networks, i.e., \gls{5g}, falls short of providing adequate broadband coverage to rural regions [2]. Moreover, even in the most technologically advanced countries, existing cellular infrastructures may lack the level of reliability, availability, and responsiveness requested by future wireless applications, and show vulnerability to natural disasters and artificial sabotage. 
% In fact, the recent geopolitical turmoils have shown how today conflicts cross the realm of physical space, and involve the cyberspace as well. In these contexts, it becomes paramount to prevent connectivity outages, which may slow down or impede appropriate emergency services, create significant damage to business and property, and loss of lives.
% The \gls{itu} foresees that in 2030 and beyond wireless broadband will be ubiquitous, and will be required to provide connectivity not only to humans, but also to a plethora of intelligent devices such as wearables, road vehicles, \glspl{uas} and robots~\cite{imt2030}. Moreover, novel use cases such as holographic communications, \gls{xr} and tactile applications will further exacerbate the throughput and latency requirements which were posed by \gls{embb} and \gls{urllc}~\cite{itu-r-2083}.

The significance of mobile networks in modern society is underscored by their paramount role in facilitating social, professional, and educational interactions. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has served as a bitter reminder of this critical importance of high-speed Internet connectivity, identifying its absence as a significant hindrance to our daily lives.
However, the current generation of cellular networks, i.e., \gls{5g}, are found wanting in providing adequate broadband coverage to rural regions~\cite{yaacoub2020key}. Furthermore, even in technologically advanced nations, cellular infrastructures often fall short of meeting the stringent reliability, availability, and responsiveness requirements of emerging wireless applications. Moreover, their vulnerability to natural disasters and cyberattacks underscores the need for networks which offer reliability from both a technological and a sociopolitical standpoint~\cite{internet_ukr_afg}.
Indeed, recent geopolitical turmoils have expanded the scope of conflict to include the cyberspace, emphasizing the imperative of maintaining uninterrupted connectivity in emergency situations. In these contexts, connectivity outages can compromise the delivery of critical services, inflict significant economic damage, and even result in loss of lives.

In light of these challenges, the \gls{itu} envisions a future where wireless broadband will be ubiquitous by 2030, with a focus on providing seamless connectivity to both humans and a vast array of intelligent devices, including wearables, autonomous vehicles, \gls{uas}, and robots [4]. The emergence of novel use cases such as holographic communications, au\gls{xr}, and tactile applications will further compound the peak throughput and latency requirements posed by emerging technologies like \gls{embb} and \gls{urllc}~\cite{itu-r-2083}.
To meet these goals, future cellular systems will further evolve \gls{5g} networks, which have introduced a flexible, virtualized architecture, the support for \gls{mmwave} communications and the use of \gls{m-mimo} technologies~\cite{ghosh20195g}. Notably, the research community is considering a more central role for \glspl{mmwave}, a further expansion of the spectrum towards the \gls{thz} band, and an \gls{ai}-native network design, with the goal of achieving autonomous data-centric orchestration and management of the network~\cite{polese20216g}, possibly down to the air interface~\cite{hoydis2021toward}.

The \gls{thz} and \gls{mmwave} bands offer large chunks of untapped bandwidth which operators can leverage to meet the Tb/s peak rates that are envisioned by the ITU~\cite{imt2030}. However, this portion of the spectrum is plagued by unfavorable propagation characteristics, comprising a marked free-space propagation loss and susceptibility to blockages~\cite{han2018propagation, jornet2011channel}, which make it challenging to harvest its potential. Although the harsh propagation environment can be partially mitigated by using directional links 
and densifying network deployments~\cite{polese2020toward}, 
the support for \gls{mmwave} and \gls{thz} bands entails a major redesign not only of the physical layer, but of the whole cellular protocol stack~\cite{shafi2018microwave}. For instance, the intrinsic directionality of the communication requires ad hoc control procedures~\cite{heng2021six}, while the frequent transitions between \gls{los} and \gls{nlos} conditions call for an ad hoc transport layer design, such as novel \gls{tcp} algorithms~\cite{zhang2019will}. 
In addition, as the network progressively becomes increasingly complex and heterogeneous, the push for spectrum expansion will be coupled with an \gls{ai}-native design which, thanks to the ongoing virtualization, will not be limited to the radio link level, but will encompass the orchestration of large scale deployments as well~\cite{polese2023understanding}.


Nevertheless, how to design, test and eventually deploy management and orchestration algorithms is an open research challenge~\cite{polese2022colo}.
First, the training data must accurately capture the interplay of the whole protocol stack with the wireless channel. Furthermore, optimization frameworks such as \gls{drl} also call for preliminary testing in isolated yet realistic environments, with the goal of minimizing the performance degradation to actual network deployments~\cite{lacava2022programmable, amir2023safehaul}.

% In addition, to reach these broad objectives towards next generation networks, among other
% innovations, both 3GPP and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) (with
% 802.11ad/ay amendments [7, 8]) agreed on the importance of expanding the frequency bands on
% which devices can operate to the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum range (loosely between
% 24-100 GHz). The possibility of working at mmWave has been initially assessed with the work
% in [9], which paved the way to numerous other contributions to this topic. However, while
% operating at such high frequencies is appealing thanks to bigger chunks of available bandwidth
% and, consequently, a higher achievable throughput and lower latency, it also introduces multiple
% challenges such as, for example: (i) higher attenuation on long-distance links, due to sever path
% loss, (ii) need of new antennas with directionality capabilities, and (iii) need for an update of
% all the layers of the protocol stack, to accommodate for new communication mechanisms (e.g.,
% cross-layer optimization, new Medium Access Control (MAC) layer that implements dedicated
% beam management strategies, precise channel models, etc.).
% Nonetheless, mmWave bands have been studied as the candidate tecnology for heterogeneous
% scenarios, such as near real-time short distance communication, Integrated Access and Back-
% haul (IAB) [10] and even to support novel vehicular communication use cases [11] (to enable,
% for example, autonomous driving applications). In fact, while a vehicular scenario introduces an
% additional level of di\ufb00iculty associated to high-speed communications (including a heavier im-
% pact on the Doppler shift), operating in the mmWave band to achieve multi-Gbps throughput
% and ultra-low latency could benefit several applications. The algorithms that take real-time
% decisions on driving commands, for example, have to rely on a huge amount of data on the
% environment, collected by heterogeneous sensors (e.g., RGB cameras, depth cameras and Light
% Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors) and exchanged among nearby vehicles. Considering
% the critical use of this information, we need also to take into account the Age of Information
% (AoI), i.e., the time since the data was generated [12]. A fast transmission is then fundamental,
% as the high mobility of the scenario might quickly lead to obsolete packets, forcing the driving
% algorithm to make decisions based on data that do not represent the environment.
% To enable these new scenarios, there is the need to optimize different aspects of the communi-
% cation workflow, from a thorough characterization of the applications of interest (e.g., to better
% understand how to schedule resources based on the tra\ufb00ic sources) to the precise modeling of
% the signal propagation. Still, during these years, the general lack of a proper instrumentation
% to accurately test new solutions on real-word testbeds (usually related to the prohibitive cost
% of hardware operating at mmWave, jointly with the diﬀiculty of implementing solutions on
% scenarios as diﬀicult as the automotive one), further slowed down the go-to-market of mmWave-
% capable devices. Fortunately, thanks to increasingly precise simulation tools (such as Network
% Simulator 2 (ns-2) [13], Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) [14], OMNeT++ [15], etc.), the hardware
% availability might turn fundamental only in the final steps of the study, to assess the best so-
% lutions chosen from those studied through extensive simulations. Among the main features of
% ns-3, one of the main research tools used to obtain the results discussed in this thesis, its mod-
% ularity allows researchers to create solutions completely from scratch, as well as add features
% on modules openly available and that have been thoroughly used and tested by the community.
% An example consists of ns3-mmwave [16], a 5G-NR-compliant and openly available module [17],
% that allows the simulation of next-generation networks operating at mmWave.
% It has also to be acknowledged that, in the recent years, there has been an effort from gov-
% ernment agencies all over the world to create fundings opportunities for research institutions
% to support the creation of public platforms to carry out advanced research in wireless com-
% munications, to fill the gap described above. An example consists in the US-based Plaftorms
% for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) initiative, a $100$ million partnership funded by the
% National Science Foundation (NSF) and a consortium of 30 companies and associations, for the
% creation of 4 city-scale research testbeds [18]. The European Union, instead, to combat the
% negative impact of COVID-19, agreed to invest together €750 billion (in 2018 prices) to build a
% greener, more digital and more resilient Europe. Part of these funds has already been allocated
% towards research and innovation, which will use it, among other things, to sustain the costs of
% top-notch instrumentation and open hardware facilities [19].
% To sum up, in this dissertation, besides giving a detailed overview of the aforementioned
% problems, we contribute to the state of the art with improvements that span from the creation
% of novel ns-3 modules, to the design of artificial intelligence algorithms to proactively assist
% teleoperated driving operations, to the setup of a reproducible workflow for carrying out end-
% to-end measurements on a public platform for wireless research. Even though we touched on
% very diverse topics, from indoor network operations for XR applications to intelligent vehicular
% networks, they were all connected by the interest in studying and evaluating different technolo-
% gies that make up the next generation of mobile networks. Where possible, after assessing their
% peculiarities and the problems that might arise for specific use cases, we tried to propose new
% ad hoc solutions, or optimization to existing ones. It is also important to mention that the
% presented work is the fruit of the collaboration with several researchers from world-leading uni-
% versities, industries and research institutions, without whom reaching such relevant outcomes
% would have not been possible. To properly acknowledge this collaborative effort from all the
% authors, besides including at the end of this thesis a list of all the publications from these
% 3-years of Ph.D. (accepted or in the process of review), at the beginning of each chapter we also
% list the papers to refer to for the original work.
